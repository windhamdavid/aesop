Aesop Story Engine is an open-sourced suite of tools that empowers developers to build feature-rich, interactive, long-form storytelling themes for Wordpress. ASE is the same engine that drives the storytelling experience through our hosted platform.

At the heart of ASE are the storytelling components. Interactive elements are created while crafting stories, with the Story Component Creator. These components include:  

= Audio =

  
= Video = 


= Content = 


= Character =
 

= Galleries =
 

= Chapter Headings = 


= Image =  


= Locations = 
 

= Parallax = 
 

= Quote =
 

= Timeline = 


= Collections =  


= Document Viewer =  


Note: The story engine largely depends on the a capable theme to take advantage of all features. However, most components can be used with no issues. Refer to the Help tab in the edit-posts screen, as well as the help tab within the edit galleries screen for more information, and help. 

Developers will find our documentation through and covering everything from the markup that is generated, to actions, filters, and theme implementation.
